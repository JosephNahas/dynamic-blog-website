the project will consist of three html pages:

- index.html will be the homepage and will list the blog posts.
- new-post.html will be used to create new blog posts.
- post.html will be used to view and edit posts.

Each post will consist of a title, content section and an optional image. The post data will be stored and retrieved using the webstorage API.
